# Research Insights on Aggregate Data

## General Introduction
Aggregate data refers to data that is collected and presented in summary form for purposes such as statistical analysis or reporting. This type of data is often used to identify trends, make comparisons, and support decision-making processes. Unlike microdata, which contains individual records, aggregate data groups data points into larger categories, preserving privacy and simplifying analysis. It is widely used across various fields such as economics, public health, and social sciences to draw inferences and guide policy-making.
