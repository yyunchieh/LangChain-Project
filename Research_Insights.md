## General Introduction
Aggregate data refers to data that is collected and presented in summary form for statistical analysis. It is typically used to provide an overview of large datasets by grouping individual data points into larger categories or sets. This type of data is instrumental in fields like economics, epidemiology, and social sciences, where it helps identify patterns, trends, and correlations within large populations. Aggregate data can be used to make informed decisions by providing a high-level view of the data, though it often lacks the granularity needed for detailed individual analysis.
