# Research Insights on Edge AI

## General Introduction
Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms on devices that are located at the edge of the network, rather than relying on centralized cloud computing resources. This approach allows for real-time data processing, reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and decreased bandwidth usage. Edge AI is particularly beneficial in environments where immediate decision-making is critical, such as autonomous vehicles, smart cameras, and IoT devices. By processing data locally, it also addresses privacy concerns associated with transmitting sensitive information to centralized servers.
