## General Introduction
Edge AI refers to the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms directly on edge devices, such as smartphones, IoT devices, and other local hardware, rather than relying on centralized cloud-based data centers. This approach enables real-time data processing and decision-making at the source of data generation, reducing latency, bandwidth usage, and enhancing privacy and security. Edge AI is increasingly important as the number of connected devices grows and the demand for instantaneous processing of large volumes of data rises.
